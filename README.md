## Introduction
In this discussion my team and I will talk about different study techniques.
This is a framework that helps learners reduce mental stress and improve productivity.
Each section is written by a different team member.

## Spaced repetition
<!-- Mangale Ngome will write this section -->
**Spaced repetition** entails the spreading of study sessions over increasing intervals, for example 1 day, then 3 days, then 1 week later rather than cramming. This technique resets the "forgetting curve" and cements knowledge in long-term memory.

### why learners should use this technique
-It moves information from short-term to long-term memory effectively.
-It prevents cramming by spreading sessions over weeks or even months.
-It saves time by focusing only on the material you are about to forget.

### how to get started
1. Create clear, concise flashcards or notes for your specific topic.
2. Review the material immediately, then again after 24 hours.
3. Increase the gap e.g., *3 days, 7 days, 14 days* as your recall improves.
