## Introduction
In this discussion my team and I will talk about different study techniques.
This is a framework that helps learners reduce mental stress and improve productivity.
Each section is written by a different team member.

## Spaced repetition
<!-- Mangale Ngome will write this section -->
**Spaced repetition** entails the spreading of study sessions over increasing intervals, for example 1 day, then 3 days, then 1 week later rather than cramming. This technique resets the "forgetting curve" and cements knowledge in long-term memory.

### why learners should use this technique
-It moves information from short-term to long-term memory effectively.
-It prevents cramming by spreading sessions over weeks or even months.
-It saves time by focusing only on the material you are about to forget.

### how to get started
1. Create clear, concise flashcards or notes for your specific topic.
2. Review the material immediately, then again after 24 hours.
3. Increase the gap e.g., *3 days, 7 days, 14 days* as your recall improves.

## Active recall
<!-- Ian Gachengo will write this section -->
**Active recall** is a study technique where you actively test yourself on material instead of passively rereading notes. Instead of looking at information repeatedly, you close your notes and try to retrieve the information from memory.

For example, after studying a topic, you ask yourself questions about it without looking at your notes, then check your answers.

This strengthens memory by forcing your brain to retrieve information — which improves long-term retention.

### why learners should use this technique
It strengthens memory more than rereading or highlighting.

It reveals what you don’t know so you can focus on weak areas.

It improves exam performance because exams require recall, not recognition.

It builds deeper understanding through repeated self-testing.

### how to get started
Study a small section of material.

Close your book or notes.

Write down or say everything you remember.

Check your answers and correct mistakes.

Repeat until you can recall the material confidently.
